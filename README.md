# Spacemacs Layers

![Stallman Quote](stallman.jpg)

This repository contains my personal [configuration layers][conf_layers] for
[Spacemacs][spacemacs].

Most of these layers are pretty independent, but may require utilities defined
in the `cb-core` layer.

# Installation

Clone this repo, then, while clutching a crucifix, run `make`.
