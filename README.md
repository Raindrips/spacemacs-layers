# Spacemacs Layers

![Stallman Quote](stallman.jpg)

This repository contains my personal [configuration layers][conf_layers] for
[Spacemacs][spacemacs].

Most of these layers are pretty independent, but may require utilities defined
in the `cb-core` layer.

# Installation

Clone this repo, then, while clutching a crucifix, run `make`.

~~I only support the current version of Spacemacs on the `master` branch. If you
use `develop` with this config you're living dangerously.~~

This is currently based on develop, because the Spacemacs maintainers think
having a develop branch that everyone has to use is somehow better than having
focused topic branches on top of master. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
